Half a bee, philosophically,
Must, ipso facto, half not be.
But half the bee has got to be
Vis a vis, its entity. D'you see?

But can a bee be said to be
Or not to be an entire bee
When half the bee is not a bee
Due to some ancient injury?
      -singing

La dee dee, one two three,
Eric the half a bee.
A B C D E F G,
Eric the half a bee.
